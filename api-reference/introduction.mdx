You can use Chartbrew's API to create, read, update, and delete charts, dashboards, and more. 
To authenticate your requests, you'll need to create an API key in Chartbrew.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens added to the header of your request.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.chartbrew.com/project/65342" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Main endpoint

If you're using our managed service, the main endpoint is `https://api.chartbrew.com`.

If you're self-hosting Chartbrew, update the endpoint to your own.

This documentation site will use the managed service endpoint for the examples.

## Documentation notices

The is a `What is a...` section for each endpoint. This is where you can learn how 
each resource works and how to use them.
