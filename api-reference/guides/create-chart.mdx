<Note>
  Creating a chart is a multi-step process since a chart depends on a few items to work.
</Note>

## Using Quick-create routes

1. Create a `Connection` to authenticate with your data source - [**/team/:team_id/connection**](/api-reference/endpoint/connections/create)
2. Create a `Dataset` with quick-create to fetch and format the data from the data soucer - [**/team/:team_id/datasets/quick-create**](/api-reference/endpoint/datasets/quick-create)
3. Create a `Chart` with quick-create to create the chart with all its chart dataset configs in one go - [**/project/:project_id/chart/quick-create**](/api-reference/endpoint/charts/quick-create)

## Using individual routes

1. Create a `Connection` to authenticate with your data source - [**/team/:team_id/connection**](/api-reference/endpoint/connections/create)
2. Create a `Dataset` that we will use to format the data from the data source - [**/team/:team_id/dataset**](/api-reference/endpoint/datasets/create)
3. Create a `DataRequest` to fetch the data from the data source. We need to connect this to the dataset we created before using the `dataset_id` field - [**/team/:team_id/dataset/:dataset_id/dataRequest**](/api-reference/endpoint/datarequests/create)
4. Create a `Dashboard` where we will place the chart - [**/project**](/api-reference/endpoint/dashboards/create)
5. Create a `Chart` and connect it to the dashboard we created before using the `project_id` field - [**/project/:project_id/chart**](/api-reference/endpoint/charts/create)
6. Create a `ChartDatasetConfig` and connect it to the relevant dataset and chart through the `dataset_id` and `chart_id` fields - [**/project/:project_id/chart/:chart_id/chart-dataset-config**](/api-reference/endpoint/chartdatasetconfigs/create)
