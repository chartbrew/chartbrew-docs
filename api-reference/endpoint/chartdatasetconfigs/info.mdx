A `ChartDatasetConfig` is used to map a dataset to a chart with custom parameters.

A `ChartDatasetConfig` belongs to a `Chart` and will need a `chart_id` and `dataset_id` when creating one. A `chart_id` is the ID of a `Chart` where you want to add the dataset to, and a `dataset_id` is the ID of a `Dataset` that you want to map to the chart.
