A chart is a visualization of data. It's used to display data from your datasets in a visual way.

A `Chart` is made of one or more `ChartDatasetConfigs`. Each `ChartDatasetConfig` is used to map a dataset to a chart with custom parameters.

A `Chart` belongs to a `Dashboard` and will need a `project_id` when creating one. A `project_id` is the ID of a `Dashboard` where you want to add the chart to.
