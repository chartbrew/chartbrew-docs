Webhooks are used by Chartbrew to send chart alerts. Chartbrew also supports sending data to Slack through the [Incoming Webhook integration](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

## Webhook Chart Alerts

Chartbrew sends `POST` requests to the webhook URL with the following payload:

| Key            | Type      | Description                                                   |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chart`        | `string`  | The name of the chart that triggered the alert               |
| `alert`        | `object`  | Alert configuration details                                   |
| `alert.type`   | `string`  | One of `milestone`, `threshold_above`, `threshold_below`, `threshold_between`, `threshold_outside`, or `anomaly` |
| `alert.rules`  | `object`  | Trigger rules for the alert                                   |
| `alertsFound`  | `array`   | Array of objects representing the matching data points       |
| `dashboardUrl` | `string`  | Link to the dashboard where the chart lives                  |
| `snapshotUrl`  | `string`  | (Optional) A preview image of the chart at alert time        |

Example Payload:

```json
{
  "chart": "Site stats",
  "alert": { "type": "milestone", "rules": { "value": "40" } },
  "alertsFound": [
    { "label": "2023 Jan 13", "value": 47 }
  ],
  "dashboardUrl": "https://app.chartbrew.com/project/1",
  "snapshotUrl": "https://api.chartbrew.com/uploads/1234567890.png"
}
```
You can use this payload structure to build automation scripts, store triggered alert logs, or notify other tools in your stack.

## Test Webhooks Before You Go Live

To test and debug your webhook integrations easily, try using:

- [**Beeceptor**](https://beeceptor.com/) – Quickly set up a custom endpoint and inspect incoming payloads.
- [**Typed Webhook**](https://typedwebhook.tools/) – Validate and simulate webhook requests with custom schemas.


## Slack Webhook

When sending data to Slack, Chartbrew will also attach a `blocks` property to the payload. This is an array of `objects` that contain the [Slack blocks](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) to be rendered in the message.
