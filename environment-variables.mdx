The table below shows the `production` variables. The `development` variables have the same naming, but they are appended with `_DEV` (example: `CB_DB_NAME` -> `CB_DB_NAME_DEV`)

### Generate the encryption key

You will need a 32 bytes AES encryption key for the `CB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable. Chartbrew generates both `CB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `CB_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DEV` for you during the first run, but if you wish to have control over the value, you can generate it yourself.

Run the following command to generate a valid key:

```sh
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```
